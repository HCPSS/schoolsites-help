title: "New ES/MS Site Functionality"
---

The new Elementary and Middle School site themes are based on improvements from the High School sites. The majority of site management functions that web managers learned and used in their previous templates still apply. However, there are a few functionality updates that web managers should be aware of. 

## What came over

All your previous site's content including news messages, staff listings, basic pages, and the school resources section. 

## What didn't come over

### Newsletters

The newsletter section is now disabled. We encourage schools to consider utilizing the news editorial process that we've piloted with a few schools already. 

Feel free to contact us if you'd like web services to look at your current news process. There's also a screencast and detailed instruction on the process in full.

### Galleries

If you visit High School websites, they have galleries on their homepages. Web services has decided not to roll this out for Elementary and Middle School websites until we've further refined the authoring process for galleries. 

If you'd like to be part of the galleries pilot in the future, feel free to contact us.

## What's new or updated

### Homepage news list

Nine news items can now live on the homepage instead of five. These items can still be a mixture of news messages and events. 

To select either a news message or event to add to the homepage, note the dropdown next to **"add new highlight"** and **"add existing highlight"**.

Select the type of highlight you'd like to get on the homepage, then click **"add new highlight"** to create a highlight from scratch, or click **"add existing highlight"** to add a highlight that's already on your site.

### News messages

At the bottom of your news message editor, you'll see a new section for news message summaries.

This section will appear if the news message is featured on your homepage. The homepage tile will contain the summary to let users know a bit more about what they're clicking through to.

> Note: the summary may get truncated on the homepage after you hit publish

**Best practice:** web managers should copy the first sentence of their news message and paste it into the news message summary field. 

### Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) page

This is new for all school sites. Consult with your school's IEQ team leader (typically the assistant principal) to learn more about the scope of IEQ forms.
