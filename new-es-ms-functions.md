title: "New ES/MS Site Functionality"
---

The new Elementary and Middle School site themes are based on improvements from the High School sites. The majority of site management functions that web managers learned and used in their previous sites still apply. However, there are a few updates that web managers should be aware of. 

## What will come over?

All your previous site's content including news messages, staff listings, basic pages, and the school resources section will be migrated to a new theme. 

## What won't come over?

### Newsletter uploader

The newsletter section is now a deprecated feature. We encourage schools to utilize the news editorial process that we've recently piloted with a few schools. 

View a [screencast](https://vimeo.com/122653964){:target="_blank"} and [instructions](http://hcpss.github.io/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/editorial-process.html) on the process to learn more.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a> if you'd like web services to look at your current news release process. 

**Still need to upload a PDF newsletter?** <a href="#newsletter-replace">Learn how &darr;</a>

### Galleries

If you visit the High School websites, they have galleries on their homepages. Web services has decided not to roll this out for Elementary and Middle School websites until we've further refined the authoring process for galleries. 

If you'd like to be part of the galleries pilot in the future, feel free to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a>.

### Free-form tagging

We've decided to turn off free-form tagging to help web managers better maintain their tagging process. Instead, pre-defined tags can now be accessed via a dropdown in news posts.

The tags web managers added before their migration, by using the tagging field on news posts, will carry over to the new sites. However, they will not be in the dropdown unless schools have a few in mind they'd like to continue to use.

Learn more about <a href="#tags">the new way to tag</a> news posts.

## What's new or updated?

### Homepage news list

Nine news items can now live on the homepage instead of five. These items can still be a mixture of news messages and events. 

To select either a news message or event to add to the homepage, click on the dropdown next to **"add new highlight"** and **"add existing highlight"**.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/es-ms-functionality/news-versus-event.png)

Select the type of highlight you'd like to get on the homepage, then click **"add new highlight"** to create a highlight from scratch, or click **"add existing highlight"** to add a highlight that's already on your site.

### News messages

At the bottom of your news message editor, you'll see a new section for news message summaries. 

**Best practice:** web managers should copy the first sentence of their news message and paste it into the news message summary field. 

![](/schoolsites-help/images/es-ms-functionality/news-message-summary.png)

This section will appear if the news message is featured on your homepage. The homepage tile will contain the summary to let users know a bit more about what they're clicking through to. 

![](/schoolsites-help/images/es-ms-functionality/news-message-title.png)

> Note: the summary may get truncated on the homepage after you hit publish

<span id="tags"></span>

### Tagging news messages

We've added to default tags sites that we found were common across other school sites. These tags allow web managers to group related messages together for easy access, and will appear at the bottom of news messages for end-users to click on.

If you'd like more tags added to the dropdown, <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a> and we'll find the best solution.

### Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) page

This is new for all school sites. Forms will come from your school's IEQ team leader (typically the assistant principal) and you'll have to upload them to the IEQ page.

## Adding a PDF Newsletter on the New Sites

The newsletter section is now a deprecated feature. If your school isn't ready for the news editorial process, there is still a way to upload PDF newsletters **as a news message.**

### The newsletter's filename

Before uploading, it's best to prefix the newsletter's file name with the date listed on the PDF itself. For instance, this newsletter is coming out on October 15, 2016. Therefore, the file name should be **"2016-10-15-fres-newsletter.pdf"**. 

Keep the month second and the day last before the acronym. "fres" should be replaced with your school's acronym. 

### Adding a newsletter title

**Titling is different from naming**. Titling a newsletter can only be done if you are the one turning it from a word document into a PDF. 

The title is what will show up in search. 

Make it standard practice to change the document title before saving PDFs for your website. This ensures that after it’s uploaded, your site’s search engine will be able to properly go through and display descriptive search result titles for end users.

#### On a Mac

Create a PDF from any word document:

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/save-as.png)

You’ll eventually be brought to this view:

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/new-save.png)

This is a standard view for saving PDF files. Normally, we would just click save and be done with it. However, notice that there’s a few fields before the save button.

Those fields are where you can edit the metadata of your PDF file and the “title” area is what will display in search results.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/editing-title.png)

**For a newsletter**, try titling it "FRES Newsletter - October 15, 2016". Replace "FRES" with your school's acronym.

#### On a PC

After clicking on “save as…”, you’ll be brought to the document window. Switch the type to “PDF”. Before saving, click to edit the “title” area. Add a title, and then click on “save”.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-title-pc.png)

Don’t worry about any other fields.

### Uploading your newsletter

**Go to "add and manage files" in your dashboard.**

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-manage-files.png)

Click on "add file".

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-file-button.png)

Select “choose file” and find the file you would like to upload from your computer. You can select a file up to 20MB in size.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/choose-file.png)

Click on "next" and you will be brought to a page where the file “lives”.

**Avoid linking to this page** because it’s for admins only.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/placeholder-page.png)

Click on the file name under the “view, edit, etc.” menu.

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/get-file-link.png)

It will bring you to a view of just the file in it’s entirety.

The URL should look like this: /sites/default/files/your-file-name.pdf

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/pdf-url.png)

**Copy this URL.**

### Adding it to a news message

Go back to the dashboard and click on "add message".

![](/schoolsites-help/images/news/add-message.png)

Inside the news message editor, add a title that has the newsletter's name along with the date it's being released.

The content of the message should also have a description of what's in the newsletter. Pick two important topics to preview the content, and add a link to the PDF file's URL that's was copied earlier. 

**Best practice:** add the link in the next that says "view our..." or "read more...". Action verbs are best (not "click here...") to let users know what's on the other side of the link.  

![](/schoolsites-help/images/news/full-news-message-updated.png)

The news message summary can just be the first sentence of the news item. This is what will show up on the homepage tile if it's added to the homepage.

Additionally, we'll be rolling out a tag for schools that are still using PDF newsletters. Under "tags" you may see a newsletter tag. Selecting this will group all the newsletters together under one central tag. 

Let us know if you can't see the tag and we can add it for you.
