title: "New ES/MS Site Functionality"
---

The new Elementary and Middle School site themes are based on improvements from the High School sites. The majority of site management functions that web managers learned and used in their previous sites still apply. However, there are a few updates that web managers should be aware of. 

## What will come over?

All your previous site's content including news messages, staff listings, basic pages, and the school resources section will be migrated to a new theme. 

## What doesn't come over?

### Newsletter uploader

The newsletter section is now disabled. We encourage schools to consider utilizing the news editorial process that we've piloted with a few schools already. 

View a [screencast](https://vimeo.com/122653964){:target="_blank"} and [detailed instructions](http://hcpss.github.io/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/editorial-process.html) on the process to learn more.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a> if you'd like web services to look at your current news release process. 

### Galleries

If you visit the High School websites, they have galleries on their homepages. Web services has decided not to roll this out for Elementary and Middle School websites until we've further refined the authoring process for galleries. 

If you'd like to be part of the galleries pilot in the future, feel free to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a>.

### Free-form tagging

We've decided to turn off free-form tagging to help web managers better maintain their tagging process. Instead, pre-defined tags can now be accessed via a dropdown in news posts.

The tags web managers added before their migration, by using the tagging field on news posts, will carry over to the new sites. However, they will not be in the dropdown unless schools have a few in mind they'd like to continue to use.

## What's new or updated?

### Homepage news list

Nine news items can now live on the homepage instead of five. These items can still be a mixture of news messages and events. 

To select either a news message or event to add to the homepage, click on the dropdown next to **"add new highlight"** and **"add existing highlight"**.

Select the type of highlight you'd like to get on the homepage, then click **"add new highlight"** to create a highlight from scratch, or click **"add existing highlight"** to add a highlight that's already on your site.

### News messages

At the bottom of your news message editor, you'll see a new section for news message summaries. 

**Best practice:** web managers should copy the first sentence of their news message and paste it into the news message summary field.

This section will appear if the news message is featured on your homepage. The homepage tile will contain the summary to let users know a bit more about what they're clicking through to.

> Note: the summary may get truncated on the homepage after you hit publish

### Tagging news messages

We've added to default tags sites that we found were common across other school sites. These tags allow web managers to group related messages together for easy access, and will appear at the bottom of news messages for end-users to click on.

If you'd like more tags added to the dropdown, <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">contact us</a> and we'll find the best solution.

### Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) page

This is new for all school sites. Forms will come from your school's IEQ team leader (typically the assistant principal) and you'll have to upload them to the IEQ page.
