The search feature on your website is handled by a miniature version of google that searches **just** your website's news items, pages, and any files that you've uploaded. This same feature is used on the hcpss.org website.

If you do a search on hcpss.org, you'll notice that PDF files are thrown into the mix with descriptive titles to give users insight into the content.

Initially, hcpss.org didn't have search titles for PDF documents. As a consequence when search was integrated, going through and trying to find PDFs using search was difficult. This was because each PDF file didn't have the correct **metadata** feeding in a proper title for search results.

> **Metadata** is a term for data that's behind the scenes inside of any given file. It's usually only read by computers, but plays a huge role in displaying search results

If I were to do the same search for "athletics" without proper metadata, then PDF files would come back titled "document" or "file name" rather than anything descriptive.

This was eventually fixed on hcpss.org and can be managed at the school website level to improve search results. 

When you save a PDF, you're also saving it's metadata.

## Where can I edit a PDFs metadata?

### On a Mac

Create a PDF from any word document:

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/save-as.png)

You'll eventually be brought to this view:

![](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/new-save.png)

This is a standard view for saving PDF files. Normally, we would just click save and be done with it. However, notice that there's a few fields before the save button.

Those fields are where you can edit the metadata of your PDF file and the "title" area is what will display in search results.

### On a PC

After clicking on "save as...", you'll be brought to the document window. Switch the type to "PDF". Before saving, click to edit the "title" area. Add a title, and then click on "save".

Don't worry about any other fields.

## Naming tricks and tips

Make it standard practice to change the document title before saving PDFs for your website. This ensures that after it's uploaded, your site's search engine will be able to properly go through and display descriptive search result titles for end users.

> Don't worry about the author, subject and keywords areas

If I had not re-titled the document from "sample-doc" to "2015 Parent Night Information", then a user would see "sample-doc" and not the more descriptive title. They would have some trouble understanding what they're clicking on without that proper title.

The title area is flexible with what can go in there. However, try to use dates because you might upload several more Parent Night Information documents in the future and it's useful to have the results differentiate them by year.
