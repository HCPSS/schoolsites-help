This topic goes over how to upload a PDF to your site. Galleries and image management is a seperate topic. It's useful if you know how to [add links already](/schoolsites-help/nodes-hs/2015/06/22/toolbar-usage/#links) before going over file management.

## Think about it

To make the work less cumbersome on school site managers it's suggested that you try and link to the hcpss.org files as much as possible.

For instance, on [this page](http://www.hcpss.org/about-us/forms/) there are commonly requested forms for field trips, medications, and absences. On [this page](http://www.hcpss.org/parents/) you can find the child abuse training materials for parent chaperones. 

If you link to an hcpss.org hosted file, then whenever that file is updated you will not have to worry about re-uploading the new version. We maintain the content so you won't have to.

## File Naming

When you are uploading your own files, naming them is an important aspect of effective file management. Replacing files is much easier once you've given them "cleaner" file names. 

**Don't do this:** "School Supply list 2015-16.pdf"

- The spaces in this file are problematic for search once it's implemented on your site. The date in the name will also make it difficult to upload the new 2016-2017 school supply list in the future. 

**Do this instead:** "school-supply-list.pdf"

- Using hyphens is friendlier for site search, and the lack of dates allows for an easier file replacement process once the time comes. Instead of having multiple files with multiple years listed, it's easier to have one generically named file that you can change every once and while. 

## Uploading

Files such as PDFs or images can be uploaded to your site and used anywhere the edit toolbar is located. If you're unfamiliar with the editing toolbar, [check out our documentation.](/schoolsites-help/nodes-hs/2015/06/22/toolbar-usage/) The editing toolbar is used in news items, basic pages, clubs, athletic teams, or events. 

Start at the dashboard and go under "manage files", and then click on "add &amp; manage files".

![add and manage files](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/add-manage.png)

This brings you over to the central area with all of the image and PDF files currently on your site. 

To upload a new file, click on "add photo or file".

![add photo or file](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/add-function.png)

Go to "choose file" and then find the file on your computer. This example is going to use a PDF file, but word docs and spreadsheets work as well. 

> However, PDFs are the most commonly used on the web and more secure than word files

![replace feature](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/choose-replace.png)

Click on "next" once you have a file queued up.

You'll be brought to a placeholder screen. Click on the .pdf link to get the link for sharing the file. 

![click .pdf for the file](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/to-file.png)

Copy and paste the link that's been generated in the URL bar, which can now be added as a link on your site.

If you're unfamiliar with adding links, [check out our documentation.](/schoolsites-help/nodes-hs/2015/06/22/toolbar-usage/#links)

## Pre-existing Files

You can click on edit to work with an existing file. 

![editing](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/add-photo-file.png)

For images, you can change the name or alt text. The alt, or alternative, text is used by screen readers to gather context about an image for the visually impaired. Try to sum up the image in a sentence or less and add it to the alt text area.

Don't worry about the title text.

### Replace a File

The edit screen is where you can replace a file as well. Use the "choose file" feature just like before and find the file you want to upload. Make sure it has the same name so that any pre-existing links to the file do not break.

![replace file](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/replace-file.png)

Click save, and you will be brought back out to the file management page. A message should show up displaying what's been replaced.

![replace file confirm](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/replace-confirm.png)

### Delete a File

If you want to delete a file completely from your site, then look for the delete button after clicking on "edit".

![editing](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/add-photo-file.png)

![delete tab](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/delete-tabs.png)

Alternatively, you could click on delete when you're at the placeholder page as well.
