[Adding images](/schoolsites-help/media/2014/07/15/adding-images/) is a separate topic.

## Banner Images

When selecting a banner image to use on your site there are a few recommendations we have that can make your selection process easier.

**Smiling, engaged children** best showcase a positive school atmosphere.

Like this: 
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mwes.hcpss.org/" target="_blank">Manor Woods Elementary School</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://chs.hcpss.org/" target="_blank">Centennial High School</a></li>
</ul>

**Your school's unique diversity** should be captured as best as possible.

- Try to include both boys and girls in your photos

Don't worry about resizing photos, just send the files our way and we'll take care of the rest. 

## Fair Use

We ask that if you are uploading an image to be mindful of both copyright and where you grab it from. Most of the time, it's best to use images (typically photos) that you have produced. However, when using images from a google search there are some settings you should enable.

Underneath the search bar there is a "search tools" selection. When searching for an image to use on your site open the search tools pane and then usage rights. It's best to select "labeled for noncommercial reuse".
