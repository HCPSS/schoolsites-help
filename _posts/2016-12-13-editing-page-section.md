Page sections are individual blocks of content. 

These typically make up the "student services" pages on high school sites and the "get involved" page on elementary and middle school sites. 

> Site managers cannot add page sections on their own. Please contact <a href="mailto:vincent_dubay@hcpss.org">vincent_dubay@hpcss.org</a> if you'd like a page section added.

You'll know it's a page section that's editable if you hover over it and see the editing cog appear. 

![edit page section](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/edit-page-section.png)

Click on "edit" to open up the text editor for that page section. 

**Editing content on your site** is the same across all content types. [Learn more about editing content &rarr;](/schoolsites-help/edit/2014/07/15/editing-page/)

Once you've finished editing the content, don't forget to save.
