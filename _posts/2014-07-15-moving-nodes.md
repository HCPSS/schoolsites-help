title: "Moving pre-existing nodes around"
---

If you needed to move a file from family resources over to forms, you don't have to delete nodes and re-do your work. 

Moving a node from one place to another can be done by clicking on "add existing node" and then searching for what you've titled it on your site.

Once the new "add existing node" area opens up, search for the name of the pre-existing node. 

![search node](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/search-existing.png)

It will have a number associated with it, all you have to do is click on the title and then select "add node."

Remember to click on "update node" and then save once everything is in it's right place.
