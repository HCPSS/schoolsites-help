If you needed to move a file from family resources over to forms, or even move a staff member from one department to another, you don't have to permanently delete nodes and re-do your work. 

Typically, you will delete the node from where it was formerly stored. However, if it's necessary, you can have a node living in two places.

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong>don't check off the box when deleting a node if you plan on moving it. Checking off the box permanently deletes the node from your site.</p>
</blockquote>

Successfully moving a node from one place to another can be done by clicking on "add existing node" (or "add existing" followed by the content type) and then searching for what you've titled it on your site.

After the "add existing" area opens up, search for the name of the pre-existing node you'd like to add.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elementary/Middle Schools: </strong>nodes can only be moved around within their "families." For instance, a staff node cannot go on the news page, and a news node cannot go on the link resources page.<p>
</blockquote> 

The node will have a number associated with it (*the higher the number, the more recent the content*). Once it's popped up, click on the title and then select "add node." 

Remember to click on "update" and then save once everything is in it's right place.
