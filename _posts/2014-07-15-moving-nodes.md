If you needed to move a file from family resources over to forms, or even move a staff member from one department to another, you don't have to delete nodes and re-do your work. 

Moving a node from one place to another can be done by clicking on "add existing node" and then searching for what you've titled it on your site.

After the "add existing node" area opens up, search for the name of the pre-existing node you'd like to add.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong>nodes can only be moved around within their "families." For instance, a staff node cannot go on the news page, and a news node cannot go on the link resources page.<p>
</blockquote> 

The node will have a number associated with it (don't worry about it). Once it's popped up, click on the title and then select "add node." 

Make sure to delete where the node was formerly stored (don't check off the box!). However, if it's necessary, you can have a node living in two places.

Remember to click on "update node" and then save once everything is in it's right place.
