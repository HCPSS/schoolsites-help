## Link Resources

If you ever need to delete a link resource, simply click "edit", then "remove" to get rid of the link resource.

Drupal will ask you again if you want to remove it and will have a checkbox to "delete this node from the system".

However, if you wanted to delete an item from "forms" and move it over to "family resources" (or any other link resource list on the site) don't check the box off to delete it from the system. [Here's how to move pre-existing nodes.](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/moving-nodes/)
