## Link Resources

If you ever need to delete a link resource, simply click "edit", then "remove" to get rid of the link resource.

Drupal will ask you again if you want to remove it and will have a checkbox to "delete this node from the system". Check this box off if you want that node permanently deleted from your school site. 

Not checking this box off will keep the node stored on your site internally for later access if you wanted to re-add it at some other point in time.

However, if you wanted to delete an item from "forms" and move it over to "family resources" (or any other link resource list on the site) don't check the box off to delete it from the system.

## News Messages

Remember, these nodes live on the homepage for as long as you want them to. It's entirely up to you when they should be removed. 

To remove a message, simply click remove.

If you want to keep the message on your site, but not on the homepage, don't check off the box. Checking this off will delete it from your homepage and site.
