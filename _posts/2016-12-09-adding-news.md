## Overview

The most robust feature on the HCPSS school sites is the ability to post news messages. 

Anything you add as a news item will always go to the news section of your site in addition to the mobile application. The news section can be accessed by clicking on the news tab in your site's navigation.

Any news that you would post in your newsletter should also live on the site. 

### Bringing your site into your newsletter

The news section of your site can become your newsletter in a few easy steps. This is outlined in the <a href="https://vimeo.com/122653964" target="_blank">news editorial process screencast.</a>

## Adding a news item

To add a news item, go to your dashboard.

In the dashboard, go to "add message".

From there, you can add a title. 

Titles should look like **"Book Drive, starts on Dec. 3"**.

  - This has the title of the event, and lets parents know when it starts. 
  - If the news message is date-driven, add the date in the title

## The toolbar

The news message content field is where all your news content goes. The toolbar is universal throughout the website. However, <a href="/schoolsites-help/edit/2014/07/15/editing-page/">that's a different topic</a>. 

Really, the bold and link button are the most important.

## Writing news content

Brief is better, but remember that content on the web has no limitations on length. 

A great news item has the most important content first. In the example below, we have a news item about CogAT. In the first sentence, we disclose that it's for 3rd and 5th grade students, and the date range.

---

All students in 3rd and 5th grade will be taking the CogAT over the course of 3 days from November 29th through December 9th. The total testing time each day is 30 minutes, not including the time needed to read the directions and work through sample problems.

## News message summary

This also works great because it can easily be added to the the news message summary field.

That field is what will show up on the news page.

### Fitting into the editorial process

That news message summary will form the bulk of your newsletter content. Adding news to your site as soon as you hear about it allows content to go out to your community sooner than a newsletter release. 

The news section of your website becomes your newsletter and reduces the amount of time spent crafting a newsletter. <a href="">Learn more about the concept of the news editorial process</a>

## Tags

The tagging feature allows you to group like messages together on to one page. 

By default, you may not have tags enabled. However, these can be added by Web Services. Email <a href="mailto:vincent_dubay@hcpss.org">vincent_dubay@hcpss.org</a> about having tags added. 

For example, Oakland Mills High School has a tag for their PTSA messages.

Every message tagged as PTSA will push to the news section of their site, and will have a link to the page for the tag at the bottom of the news message.

All tagged PTSA messages also go to a category page with a description on the PTSA.

Once your changes are all set, hit save.

You can always come back and edit your news messages. However, if you're releasing new content, make a new news message.
