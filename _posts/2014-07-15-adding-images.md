To add images, place your cursor in an area below text and on it's own line. Then, click on the image manager button in the editor toolbar.

Choose an image from your documents, then click on upload. 

![upload file](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/upload-file.png)

After making your selection, keep it set to "public local files served by the webserver" and hit "next."

Don't worry about the alt text and title text, and then click save. The options screen that follows also doesn't have to be changed. 

Hit submit to insert the image. 

If all goes well, your image should go into the editor.

Once your changes are all set in the editor, hit "save" to make everything live.
