If you change administrator information on the staff list, the "About Us" page has their bios, contact information and images that need updating as well.

By default, the admins should be listed on the "about our school" page under your "about menu".

Most schools should have two adminstrators listed. However, if you get an administrative intern or another adminstrator and need an additional space added for them, contact <a href="mailto:vincent_dubay@hcpss.org">vincent_dubay@hcpss.org</a>

### Editing the administrator

Hover over the administrator's image or name, and click on the editing cog that shows up on the right-hand side of your screen.

This brings you to a page where you can edit their information. It's encouraged to have them write up a quick bio for the site, but it's optional.

In addition, you can upload an image of them. If they do not want an image online or you do not have one, use the stand-in image featured below as a placeholder.

Don't forget to save after you've made the changes.
