If you change administrator information on the staff list, the "About Us" page has their bios, contact information and images that need updating as well. 

In the upper left hand corner of your site, click on "find content"

This is where all your nodes are listed. At the top of the list there is a box that says "show only items where"

To the right of "type", select "Administrator" and then click "filter"

Your administrators should be shown instead of all the nodes on your site.

Click on "edit" to the far right of their name to change their information.

Save the changes when you're done.
