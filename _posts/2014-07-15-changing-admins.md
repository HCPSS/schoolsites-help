### Editing the administrator

Hover over the administrator's image or name, and click on the editing cog that shows up on the right-hand side of your screen.

This brings you to a page where you can edit the administrator’s information. We recommend including a short (2-3 sentence) bio for administrators. You also have the option upload an administrator’s photo.

In addition, you can upload an image of them. If they do not want an image online or you do not have one, use the stand-in image featured below as a placeholder.

Don't forget to save after you've made the changes.
