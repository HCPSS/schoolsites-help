Most nodes on your site can have images, bullet lists, numbered lists and links to other webpages.

Simply navigate to the page you'd like to add content to and click on "edit" to begin making changes.

You can add content to a page in the same way that you type up a word document or HCPSS News Message.

<a name="wysiwyg"></a>

Feel free to bold or italicize text as needed. Just like Microsoft Word, simply highlight the text and select bold, italicize, or underline in the editor.
