title: "Embedding a YouTube Video"
---

You can embed videos from YouTube in news messages and basic pages. The process is the same for each.

If your school wants a YouTube account to upload their own content, it should be maintained by the web manager under an email account that's not personal. YouTube videos will show up in search results, so be sure to have clearance from parents for children in videos. 

## Grabbing the Embed Code

Find the YouTube video you'd like to add. 

Underneath the video there's a "share" selection. 

Next, click on "embed" and copy the URL it generates. Keep the video size set to 560x315. Leave everything else unchecked.

## Embedding into a news message

Go to "add message" on your dashboard.

Add a title to the message, then the message itself. The ideal place for a YouTube video embed is underneath the message copy. There shouldn't be anything below the video.

In your editor there should be a "source" button. Click this and your text will change into what looks like a typewriter font.

Paste the embed code below the text.

Click on "source" again to bring you back to regular editing mode if you have anything else you'd like to edit.

Save your changes.
