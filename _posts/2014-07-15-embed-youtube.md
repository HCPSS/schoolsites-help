You can embed videos from YouTube in news messages, page sections and basic pages. The process is the same for each.

If your school wants a YouTube account to upload their own content, it should be maintained by the web manager under an email account that's not personal. YouTube videos will show up in search results, so be sure to have clearance from parents for children in videos. 

## Grabbing the Embed Code

Find the YouTube video you'd like to add. 

Underneath the video there's a "share" selection. 

Next, click on "embed". Keep the video size set to 560x315. Make sure that the "show suggested videos when the video finishes" is **NOT** checked off. Copy the URL that is generated.

## Embedding into a news message

Go to "add message" on your dashboard.

Add a title to the message, then the message itself.

In your editor there should be a "source" button. Click this and your text will change into what looks like a typewriter font.

Paste the embed code below the text.

Click on "source" again to bring you back to regular editing mode if you have anything else you'd like to edit.

> **Note:** This process is the same for news messages, page sections (ES/MS sites), and basic pages.

Don't forget to save your changes!
