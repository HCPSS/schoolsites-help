When editing a news message, page, link resource, or just about anything else on your site you'll encounter a toolbar to use in the main content area.

## Styling the text
 
To bold text, highlight a word or words and then click on the bold button. The same goes for italics.

## Links

You can link to an external website, or a page that's on your website. 

### External Sites

You should paste in the link manually if it's going to an external site. Open your link in a new window, and then copy the link's address from the URL bar located at the top of your web browser. **Never copy links directly from a message in your HCPSS email account.** Copying and pasting directly from an email message will cause problems when users try to open it.

If you want to link over to a PDF file that you've uploaded, <a href="/schoolsites-help/files/2014/07/15/uploading-files/#uploading">check out our documentation</a> on how to get the file's link.

Highlight the text you want to turn into a link, and then click on the add link button.

Once you have a link ready to go, and you've clicked on the "add link" button, paste the link into the "link URL" field. Then, click on "insert link". This will drop it into the text for you.

### Pages or other content on your site

Linking over to a pre-existing piece of content on your current site is easy because it's searchable inside of the link menu. 

Just like before, simply highlight the text you want to turn into a link. Then, search for the piece of content you want to link using anything in the title as the criteria. 

> **This will not work for PDF files.**

Once you've found the content click on the item and it will auto-fill the link area.

Click on "insert link", and the text you highlight should now be a link.

### Email addresses as links

You can add a feature to email addresses that makes them behave similar to links. It's purely optional, but does add an action step to your news messages or pages.

This feature will open a new email message window with the email address pre-loaded for users with email desktop clients or who are on mobile devices.

Same as adding a link to a website or piece of content, highlight the text you want to turn into an email address link. This could be the email address itself, or text that says "email us".

![add an email link](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/add-email-link.png)

Click on the "add link" button and enter in "mailto:" followed by the email address in the link URL field.

Now, when they click on "email us" a new message window will open up for them with the linked email address in the "To:" field.

## Pasting text from word

Often times, you'll edit something in Microsoft Word and want to bring it over to your site. Unfortunately, Word does a bunch of strange stuff behind the scenes when editing text and that often times causes issues when copied and pasted over to the web.

To ensure a clean copy and paste from Word to your site, use the "paste as plain text" function in the toolbar.

Select everything in your Word document using command+A on a Mac or control+A on a PC. Then, copy it.

![word doc copy](/schoolsites-help/images/news/word-doc-copy.png)

On your website's toolbar, select "paste as plain text"

![plain text](/schoolsites-help/images/news/plain-text.png)

Inside of the window that pops up, paste everything in and click on OK. Links or other special formatting will not come over using this feature, but it's better to do this inside of your site.

There's often times a lot of space that comes along after pasting. Just go in and fix the large spaces and you're all set.

Note that there is also a "paste from word" function, but the plain text feature does a better job of cleaning everything up.
