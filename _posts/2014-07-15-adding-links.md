This topic covers how to add links to documents in a news message, page section, or basic page. Adding documents to link resource groups (e.g. school resources) is [a different topic.](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/uploading-files/)

Adding links to documents hosted by your school site can be done by grabbing the link URL from any file you upload. If you're not sure how to find that URL, please view our documentation on [uploading files](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/uploading-files/) before proceeding.

Once you have your URL for the file you'd like to link to, highlight the text where you want the link to go. This can be anywhere in the body of your node.
