Select "add content" in the toolbar underneath "dashboard" and then click on "Club".

## Title and Body

From here, add the club's official name and then a brief summary of the club. This can include the mission statement of the club along with where it meets and when.

The description will show up on the clubs page.

## Adding Advisors

Up to five advisors can be added. If they're an existing staff member listed on the staff section of the website, click on "add existing advisor". 

Then, search for their name and hit "add advisor". This will display their contact information on the clubs page.

> Typically, you'll never have to use "add new advisor" because advisors are existing staff members.

## Adding their website

If the club has a website, add "Website" to the title field, then copy the URL to their website and paste it into the URL field.
