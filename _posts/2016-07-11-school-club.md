### Title and Body

Add the club's official name and then a brief summary of the club. This can include the mission statement of the club along with where it meets and when.

![club body and title](/schoolsites-help/images/clubs/club-title-description.jpg)

The description will show up on the clubs page.

### Adding Advisors

Up to five advisors can be added. If they're an existing staff member listed on the staff section of the website, click on "add existing advisor".

> Typically, you'll never have to use "add new advisor" because advisors are usually existing staff members.

Once the new text box appears, type in the name of the staff member, select their name in the search results, and then click "add advisor".

### Adding/Editing the Advisor
