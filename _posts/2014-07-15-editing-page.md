Depending on your school, you might have a title one, school schedule or PBIS page on your site. These editable pages are listed under the "about" tab. If you'd like a page added to your site please get in contact with us at [webmaster@hcpss.org](mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org).

## Adding Text

These pages can have images, bullet lists, numbered lists and links to other webpages.

Simply navigate to the page you'd like to add content to and click on "edit" to begin making changes.

You can add content to a page in the same way that you type up a word document or HCPSS News Message.

Feel free to bold or italicize text as needed. Just like Microsoft Word, simply highlight the text and select bold, italicize, or underline in the editor.

Once your changes are all set in the editor, hit "save" to make everything live.

## Adding Links

Adding links to documents can be done by grabbing the link URL from any file you upload. If you're not sure how to find that URL, please view our documentation on [uploading files](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/uploading-files/) before proceeding.

Once you have your URL for the file you'd like to link to, highlight the text where you want the link to go. This can be anywhere in the body of your page.

Then, click on the closed chainlink in the editor

![edit page](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/link-editor.png)

Paste the link of your choice into the URL area, and click "ok" to insert it.

Once your changes are all set in the editor, hit "save" to make everything live. 

## Adding Images

To add images, place your cursor in an area below text on it's own line. Then, click on the image manager button in the editor.

Choose an image from your documents, then click on upload. 

![upload file](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/upload-file.png)

After making your selection, keep it set to "public local files served by the webserver" and hit "next."

Don't worry about the alt text and title text, and then click save. The options screen that follows also doesn't have to be changed. 

Hit submit to insert the image. 

If all goes well, your image should go into the editor.

Once your changes are all set in the editor, hit "save" to make everything live.
