Most nodes on your site can have images, bulleted lists, numbered lists and links to other webpages.

If you are having trouble finding a node, such as a page section, view the documentation for [finding page sections](/schoolsites-help/nodes/2014/07/15/finding-content/).

If you're logged in, simply navigate to the page you'd like to add content to and click on "edit" to begin making changes.

<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> you can also find content via  your dashboard through search or from one of the administrative lists.

<a name="wysiwyg"></a>

You can add content to a page in the same way that you type up a word document or HCPSS News Message.

Feel free to bold or italicize text as needed. Just like Microsoft Word, simply highlight the text and then select bold, italicize, or underline in the editor.

There is a style feature for other settings within the editor. These include centered heading, floated image container, and well.

The centered heading will make a line of text align to the center of the node. When you select this setting in the editor, note that it will not show up until you save. 

The floated image container makes blocks of text flow around an image. This setting only works if you highlight an image in the editor, select the setting and then save. 

The well puts a gray box around your text. This is useful if you want to highlight an important link. Highlight the text you want the well to appear around, then select well in the style menu.
