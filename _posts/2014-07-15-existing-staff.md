Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed.

To change a staff member, go to the "our staff" item in the navigation. Then, hover over the department you'd like to edit. Click on the gear cog to open up the editor.

All staff in that department should be listed. 

If a teacher recently switched grades from second to fourth, you can remove them from one section and then move them to another.

First, remove them by clicking on the remove button.

You'll be given two options after clicking remove. There's a difference between the two.

## Moving versus Deleting

### Deleting

**If this staff member has left your building**, then check off the box and hit remove.

### Moving

However, if we're just moving them from one department to another, then we do not need to check off the box. Hitting "remove" without checking off the box will just remove them from the department.

Then, scroll down and hit "save" to save your changes, which will bring you back to the staff page.

Navigate to the new department that the staff member now belongs to on the staff page, and then use the cog to go in and edit. 

In the staff member's new department, hit "add exisiting staff member". This allows us to search for the staff member that we want to add to the department.

Start typing out their first or last name, and then click on them. Click on "add staff member" and this will add them to the list.

![search staff](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/search-staff.png)

From there, you can arrange them on the list however you'd like.

### Update staff name/title (if needed)

Don't forget to make sure that their title reflects their new position if applicable. Editing their name and title can be accessed by clicking on "edit" next to their name.

Note that after you've made any changes to their record, you have to click "update staff member" for the changes to go through.

Then, hit "save" to save all your changes.
