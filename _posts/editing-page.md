## Editing a page

Chances are you might have a title one, school schedule, or PBIS information page on your site. 

- Simply navigate to the page and click on "edit" to begin making some changes.

- You can add content to a page in the same way that you type up a word document or HCPSS News Message.
  - Feel free to bold or italicize text as needed. 

- Adding links to documents can be done by grabbing the link URL from any file you upload. 
  - Note: If you're not familiar with creating or finding links, please view the documentation for adding a file to your site. 

- Once your changes are all set, hit "save."
