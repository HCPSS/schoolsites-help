Pages such as "school services" and "get involved" have page sections. These nodes aren't accessible from the page itself, you have to find them in Drupal. Changing your administrators on your "About Us" page is [done similarly.](/schoolsites-help/nodes/2014/07/15/changing-staff/#admin-info)

Click on "find content" in the upper left hand corner of your site. 

![find content](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/find-content.png)

From here, you can filter content types for easier access.

Select "page section" and all page sections on your site will display. 

![filter pages](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/page-filter.png)

From here, find the section you want to make changes to and click on "edit" to begin working with that section. Save your changes when you're finished.

Note: If you go back into "find content" for a new search, you have to hit "reset" before conducting it.
