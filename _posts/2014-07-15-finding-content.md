While you can always access content right from the page itself (see the [quick editing topic](/schoolsites-help/edit/2014/07/17/contextual/)), there is a feature to search for content on your site if you're having an issue finding it.

Click on "find content" in the upper left hand corner of your site.

From here, you can filter content types for easier access.

Select "Basic Page" and all editable pages within your site will display.

From here, since we're trying to find a page, click on "edit" next to the pages you want to modify. Then, you'll be brought to the editing screen for that page.

Then, you'll be brought to the editing screen for that page.

**Note:** To conduct a new search, click “reset” and enter your new search term/criteria.
