## Editing the School Staff List

Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed. Administrators have a different protocol because they are listed under "About". 
- To change a staff member, click on the "Our Staff" menu item and then "edit".

- All departments should be listed. Click on "edit" next to the department where a staff member change is needed. 

## Adding a new staff member

- After opening up the editing area for a department click on "add new node".
- Select "create node" once you've put in the right information for your new staff member. 
- Select "update node" and then "save" to commit all changes. 

## Moving a pre-existing staff member

If a teacher recently switched grades from third to fourth, you can remove them from one section and move them to another.

- Click on "edit" to the right of the department you're moving the staff member to. 
- Under the current department staff list, click on "add existing node" and search for their name. 
- Click on "update node" and then remove them from the list they were previously in
  - Note: do not check off the box after you click on remove
- Be sure to click "save" after you're done

## Changing principal information

- This where all your nodes are listed. At the top of the list there is a box that says "show only items where"
- To the right of "type", select "Administrator" and then click "filter"
