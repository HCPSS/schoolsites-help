## Editing the School Staff List

Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed. School administrators are also listed on your "about" page. Updating that information will be covered at the end of this topic. 

To change a staff member, click on the "Our Staff" menu item and then "edit".

## Moving a pre-existing staff member

If a teacher recently switched grades from third to fourth, you can remove them from one section and move them to another.

- Click on "edit" to the right of the department you're moving the staff member to. 
- Under the current department staff list, click on "add existing node" and search for their name. 
- Click on "update node" and then remove them from the list they were previously in
  - Note: do not check off the box after you click on remove
- Be sure to click "save" after you're done

## Changing principal information

After you change their information on the staff list, the About Us page has their bios and images that need updating as well. 
- In the upper left hand corner of your site, click on "find content"
- This where all your nodes are listed. At the top of the list there is a box that says "show only items where"
- To the right of "type", select "Administrator" and then click "filter"
- Your administrators should be shown instead of all the nodes on your site.
- Click on "edit" to change their information. 
- Save your changes
