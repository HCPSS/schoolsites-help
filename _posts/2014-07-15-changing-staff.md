## Editing the School Staff List

Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed. School administrators are also listed on your "about" page. Updating your administrator's information will be covered at the end of this topic. 

To change a staff member from your dashboard, go to the "arrange and manage lists" section. 

![staff edit](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/our-staff-edit.png)

All departments should be listed. Click on "edit" next to the department where a staff member change is needed. 

![edit department](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/edit-department.png)

## Adding a new staff member

After opening up the editing area for a department click on "add new node".

![new node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/new-staff-node.png)

From here, put in the staff member's information. 

![create node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/create-node.png)

Select "create node" after your changes are all set. 

![update node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/update-node.png)

Then, select "update node" and "save" to commit all changes. 

## Moving a pre-existing staff member

If a teacher recently switched grades from third to fourth, you can remove them from one section and then move them to another.

Click on "edit" to the right of the department you're moving the staff member to. 

![move staff member](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/move-grade.png)

Under the current department staff list, click on "add existing node" and search for their name. 

![existing node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/existing-staff-node.png)

After finding their name, click on "add node.""

![adding new node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/move-staff.png)

Click on "update node" and then remove them from the list they were previously in.

Be sure that you do not check off the box after you click on remove. Only do this if they have left your school.

Click "save" after all changes are complete.

## Changing administrator information

If you change administrator information on the staff list, the "About Us" page has their bios, contact information and images that need updating as well. 

In the upper left hand corner of your site, click on "find content"

![find content](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/find-content.png)

This is where all your nodes are listed. At the top of the list there is a box that says "show only items where"

To the right of "type", select "Administrator" and then click "filter"

![find admin](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/find-admin.png)

![filter node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/filter-node.png)

Your administrators should be shown instead of all the nodes on your site.

![admin view](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/admin-only-view.png)

Click on "edit" to the far right of their name to change their information. 

![admin view](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/edit-admin.png)

Save the changes when you're done.
