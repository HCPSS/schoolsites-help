## Editing the School Staff List

Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed. School administrators are also listed on your "about" page. Updating that information will be covered at the end of this topic. 

To change a staff member, click on the "Our Staff" menu item and then "edit".

## Moving a pre-existing staff member

If a teacher recently switched grades from third to fourth, you can remove them from one section and then move them to another.

Click on "edit" to the right of the department you're moving the staff member to.

Click "save" after all changes are complete.

## Changing administrator information

If you change administrator information on the staff list, the About Us page has their bios and images that need updating as well. 

In the upper left hand corner of your site, click on "find content"

![find content](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/find-content.png)

This is where all your nodes are listed. At the top of the list there is a box that says "show only items where"

To the right of "type", select "Administrator" and then click "filter"

![find admin](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/find-admin.png)

![filter node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/filter-node.png)

Your administrators should be shown instead of all the nodes on your site.

Click on "edit" to change their information.
