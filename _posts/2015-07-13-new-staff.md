Your site should already have a School Staff page with all staff members listed. School administrators are also listed on your "about" page. Updating your administrator's information will be covered at the end of this topic. 

To change a staff member from your dashboard, go to the "arrange and manage lists" section.

All departments should be listed. Click on "edit" next to the department where a staff member change is needed.

From here, put in the staff member's information. 

![create node](/schoolsites-help/images/staff/create-node.png)

Select "create node" after your changes are all set.
