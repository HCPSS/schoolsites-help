## How do I upload a file?

- Go to dashboard in the upper left-hand side of your screen
- Under file management on the right-hand side, select "add & manage files"
- Here is where you'll find all of the files you've uploaded onto the site. To add a new file, select "add file"
- Select "choose file" and then find the file you would like to upload on your computer. Unlike HCPSS News, you can select a file that's up to 20MB in size. 
- After uploading, select next, and leave the destination set to "public local files served by the webserver."
- Clicking on next will bring you to a screen where the file "lives." 
- Click on the file name under the "view, edit, etc." menu, and then copy the URL once the file loads. 
- The URL should look like this: /sites/default/files/"yourfilename.pdf"

## Linking to the document

- For instance, if this was a school supply list you would want it under resources > family resources. For the sake of this exercise, that's where we'll put your file. 
- Now that we have a clean URL hooked up to the file, navigate over to school resources and click on "edit." 
- Under link resource groups, click on "edit" to the right of Family Resources (if you no longer have this section, simply use another one). 
- Underneath link resources, click on "add new node" and give your link a name, title (which can be the same), and drop in the URL we had generated for our file. 
- Add a description if you'd like to. 
- It's important to click on "create node" first, then "update node", and finally "save."

## Deleting a file

- If you ever need to delete a file, simply click "edit", then "remove" to get rid of the link resource.
- Drupal will ask you again if you want to remove it and will have a checkbox to "delete this node from the system". 
  - Note: If you wanted to delete the item from "forms" and move it over to "family resources" or any other part of the site, don't check the box off to delete it from the system.
  - Moving a node from one place to another can be done by clicking on "add existing node" and then searching for what you've titled it on your site
