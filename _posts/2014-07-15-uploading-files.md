This topic explores how to upload a PDF file and link to it on your site. [Replacing files](/schoolsites-help/files/es-files/2014/07/15/replacing-files/) is a separate topic, along with [adding links to external sites](/schoolsites-help/es-files/2014/07/15/adding-links/) such as sign-up genius. 

## Think about it

To make the work less cumbersome on school site managers it's suggested that you try and link to the hcpss.org files as much as possible.

For instance, on [this page](http://www.hcpss.org/about-us/forms/) there are commonly requested forms for field trips, medications, and absences. On [this page](http://www.hcpss.org/parents/) you can find the child abuse training materials for parent chaperones. 

If you link to an hcpss.org hosted file, then whenever that file is updated you will not have to worry about re-uploading the new version. We maintain the content so you won't have to.

## File Naming

When you are uploading your own files, naming them is an important aspect of effective file management. Replacing files is much easier once you've given them "cleaner" file names. 

**Don't do this:** "School Supply list 2014-15.pdf"

- The spaces in this file are problematic for search once it's implemented on your site. The date in the name will also make it difficult to upload the new 2015-2016 school supply list in the future. 

**Do this instead:** "school-supply-list.pdf"

- Using hyphens is friendlier for site search, and the lack of dates allows for an easier file replacement process once the time comes. Instead of having multiple files with multiple years listed, it's easier to have one generically named file that you can change every once and while.

## Uploading a new file

Go to dashboard in the upper left-hand side of your screen.

Under file management on the right-hand side, select "add & manage files."

![add and manage files](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-manage.png)

Here is where you'll find all of the files that have been uploaded to the site. To add a new file, select "add file."

![add file](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-file.png)

Select "choose file" and find the file you would like to upload from your computer. You can select a file up to 20MB in size.

![choose file](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/choose-file.png)

After choosing, select next, and leave the destination set to "public local files served by the webserver." 

**Note: Only Elementary Schools will have to do this step**

![served by the webserver](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/upload-destination.png)

Selecting next will bring you to a page where the file "lives." Avoid linking to this page because it's for admins only.

Click on the file name under the "view, edit, etc." menu.

![upload confirmation](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/upload-confirm.png)

It will bring you to a view of just the file in it's entirety.

The URL should look like this: /sites/default/files/"your-file-name.pdf"

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/pdf-url.png)

Copy this URL address. 

## Linking to the document in link resources

These instructions are only for adding a document to a link resource node. Adding files to [pages, page sections and news messages](/schoolsites-help/es-files/2014/07/15/adding-links/) is a bit different.

If the document you uploaded was a school supply list, then it should go on the school resources page under the family resources heading (or where you see fit). For the sake of this exercise, this is where the file will go.

Once we have a clean URL copied that goes to the file, navigate over to the dashboard and click on "link resource list." 

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/school-resources.png)

Under link resource groups, click on "edit" to the right of Family Resources.

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/family-resources.png)

This opens up a new area that hosts all links within that group.

Underneath link resources, click on "add new node".

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-new-node.png)

Give your link a name, title (which can be the same), and drop in the URL that was generated for the file. You can also add a description if you'd like to. 

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/name-title.png)

It's important to click on "create node" first, then "update node", and finally "save."
