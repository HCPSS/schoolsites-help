This topic explores how to upload a PDF file and link to it on your site. [Replacing files]() is a separate topic, along with [adding links to external sites](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/adding-links/) such as sign-up genius. 

## File Naming

Naming files is an important aspect of effective file management. Replacing files is much easier when you've given them "cleaner" file names. 

**Don't do this:** "School Supply list 2014-15.pdf"

- The spaces in this file are problematic for search once it's implemented on your site. The date in the name will also make it difficult to upload the 2015-2016 school supply list in the future. 

**Do this instead:** "school-supply-list.pdf"

- Using hyphens is friendlier for site search once it's implemented, and the lack of dates allows for an easier file replacement process once the time comes.

## Uploading a new file

Go to dashboard in the upper left-hand side of your screen.

Under file management on the right-hand side, select "add & manage files."

![add and manage files](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-manage.png)

Here is where you'll find all of the files that have been uploaded to the site. To add a new file, select "add file"

![add file](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-file.png)

Select "choose file" and find the file you would like to upload from your computer. You can select a file up to 20MB in size.

![choose file](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/choose-file.png)

After choosing, select next, and leave the destination set to "public local files served by the webserver."

![served by the webserver](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/upload-destination.png)

Selecting next will bring you to a page where the file "lives." 

Click on the file name under the "view, edit, etc." menu.

![upload confirmation](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/upload-confirm.png)

The URL should look like this: /sites/default/files/"your-file-name.pdf"

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/pdf-url.png)

Copy this URL address. 

## Linking to the document

If the document you uploaded was a school supply list, then it should go on the school resources page under the family resources heading. For the sake of this exercise, that's where we'll put your file. 

Now that we have a clean URL copied that goes to the file, navigate over to school resources and click on "edit." 

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/school-resources.png)

Under link resource groups, click on "edit" to the right of Family Resources.

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/family-resources.png)

This opens up a new area that hosts all links within that group. 

Underneath link resources, click on "add new node".

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/add-new-node.png)

Give your link a name, title (which can be the same), and drop in the URL we had generated for our file. You can also add a description if you'd like to. 

![proper URL](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/name-title.png)

It's important to click on "create node" first, then "update node", and finally "save."
