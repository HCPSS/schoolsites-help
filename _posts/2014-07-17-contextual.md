Formerly, finding certain pieces of content on your site was through either the "find content" feature or by going through the web manager dashboard. 

Now, contextual editing has been enabled on all Elementary and Middle School websites to make finding content easier for web managers. When you are logged in to edit your site, hovering over any piece of content causes a tiny gear cog to appear.

Click on it to open the edit or delete dropdown menu. From here, you can either delete the content outright or go in to edit it just as you would from the dashboard or "find content" feature.

The same styling rules apply when editing your site's content, this is just an easier way to access nodes. You cannot access menus or images using the contextual editing feature, only text-based nodes or lists such as Departments and School Resources.
