## Linking to the document in link resources

These instructions are only for adding a document to a link resource node. Adding files to [pages, page sections and news messages](/schoolsites-help/es-files/2014/07/15/adding-links/) is a bit different.

If the document you uploaded was a school supply list, then it should go on the school resources page under the family resources heading (or where you see fit). For the sake of this exercise, this is where the file will go.

Once we have a clean URL copied that goes to the file, navigate over to the dashboard and click on "link resource list."

Under link resource groups, click on "edit" to the right of Family Resources.

This opens up a new area that hosts all links within that group.

Underneath link resources, click on "add new node".

Give your link a name, title (which can be the same), and drop in the URL that was generated for the file. You can also add a description if you'd like to.

It's important to click on "create node" first, then "update node", and finally "save."
