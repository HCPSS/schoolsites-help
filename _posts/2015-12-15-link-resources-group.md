Link resource groups are ideal if you have a large list of links that all relate to one another in some logical way. 

**For example:**

- A list of links to business partnership websites
- Linking parents to grocery store bonus cards or other fundraising sources
- Links to research databases landing pages
- Websites of general family resources for parents to take advantage of

Although web managers can go in and add a link resources group, please contact Vincent Dubay (<a href="mailto:vincent_dubay@hcpss.org">vincent_dubay@hcpss.org</a>) to have it added to a page.

To create a new link resource group, go to "add content" in the left-hand side of your screen.

![add content](/schoolsites-help/images/resources/add-content.png)

From there, click on "link resource group" which will bring you to an editing page with empty fields.

![add link group](/schoolsites-help/images/resources/link-group-add.png)

These empty fields can be populated with the title of your group, such as "Business Partners" or "College Preparedness".

![add link group](/schoolsites-help/images/resources/link-group-add-field.png)

The link group description is meant for a one to two sentance summary of the link resource group. 

The description should be a quick insight into the group's content such as *"The following are some of the stores we have partnerships with. Link your rewards card to AES and these merchants will donate a percentage of your purchases to AES."*

Then, [start adding link resource items to the list](/schoolsites-help/resources/2016/12/14/link-resources-item/), which is unlimited but an ideal amount is more than 3 and less than 15.

Hit "save" to publish your changes. Then contact Vincent Dubay to have to it added to a site page.
