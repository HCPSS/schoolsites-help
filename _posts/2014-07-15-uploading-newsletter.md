Select "newsletters"

Give it a descriptive title. For example, "EFES Newsletter - 1/23/2014"

The PDF file should also have a good format. File names are recommended to be listed as "efes-newsletter-2014-01-23.pdf" or "acronym-newsletter-year-month-day." Precede any single digits with a zero.

The published date should be the date you intended the newsletter to be released on. Sometimes this is listed on the PDF, other times it's the date you're uploading the file. Don't worry about listing a time, it's not vital for the attachment.  

After naming it, attach the newsletter.
