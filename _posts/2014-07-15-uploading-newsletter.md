Give it a descriptive title. For example, "EFES Newsletter - 1/1/2014"

The published date should be the date listed in the PDF file. Don't worry about listing a time, it's not vital for the attachment.

After naming it, attach the newsletter. 

Click save, or save and add another if you have more newsletters to upload.
