There's two ways to edit this section of your homepage. The first of which is right from the homepage itself by using the contextual edit feature. Hover over the news area and look for the gear cog on the right-hand side.

Alternatively, you could go to your dashboard and click on "news and event highlights (homepage)" under arrange and manage lists.

## Overview

This area is for web managers to keep up to date. The content remains online as long as you want it and can contain a combination of news items and upcoming events.

[Creating news messages is a separate topic](/schoolsites-help/news/2016/12/09/adding-news/) that web managers should have a familiarity with.

Sites are allowed up to nine items on the homepage.

## Add a new item

In the dropdown, select whether you want to add an event or news message.

"Add new highlight" will prompt you to create a new event or news message on the fly. If you add a news message from here, it will push the content to the respective parts of the site. Unfortunately, events added here will not push to your google calendar.

"Add existing highlight" will open a search field. Just search for a pre-existing event or news message (depending on what you selected in the dropdown) by it's title. Once you've found it, click on "add highlight". The numbers indicate how recent the content was added; the higher the number, the more recent it is.

From here, you can re-arrange your news item's position by using the directional rose to the left of its title.

You can also click on edit if you want to change the contents of the news event or message. **For events**, it's better to make any changes in your Google Calendar directly rather than on the homepage.

Be sure to hit save once you're done.

## Deleting Items

These items exist on the homepage in tandem with the google calendar and news page.

To remove an item from your homepage, but not from your site altogether, click on remove.

![existing highlight](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/edit-remove-hp.png)

To remove it **just** from the homepage, click on remove without checking off the box. To remove it from the site **completely**, check off the box and click on "remove".
