Go to your dashboard and click on "news and event highlights (homepage)" under arrange and manage lists.

![arrange and manage lists](/schoolsites-help/images/news/manage-lists.png)

Sites are allowed up to nine items on the homepage.

## Add a new item

In the dropdown, select whether you want to add an event or news message.

![add new highlight](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/add-new-highlight.png)

"Add new highlight" will prompt you to create a new event or news message on the fly. If you add a news message from here, it will push the content to the respective parts of the site. Unfortunately, events added here will not push to your google calendar.

"Add existing highlight" will open a search field. Just search for a pre-existing event or news message (depending on what you selected in the dropdown) by it's title. Once you've found it, click on "add highlight". The numbers indicate how recent the content was added; the higher the number, the more recent it is.

From here, you can re-arrange your news item's position by using the directional rose to the left of its title.

You can also click on edit if you want to change the contents of the news event or message. **For events**, it's better to make any changes in your Google Calendar directly rather than on the homepage.

Be sure to hit save once you're done.

## Deleting Homepage Highlights

To remove an item from your homepage, but not from your site altogether, click on remove.

![existing highlight](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-files/edit-remove-hp.png)

To remove it **just** from the homepage, click on remove without checking off the box. To remove it from the site **completely**, check off the box and click on "remove".
