To add an Athletic Team listing to your site, go to the "add content" admin page.

![add content on toolbar](/schoolsites-help/images/uploading/toolbar-add-content.jpg)

Select "add content" in the toolbar underneath "dashboard" and then click on "Athletic Team".

## Title and Body

From here, add the athletic team's official name (e.g., "Boys' Junior Varsity Soccer" or "Girls' Varsity Basketball") and then a brief summary of the team. This can include what season the sport is played in or when tryouts take place.

Currently, the body section doesn't display on the athletic teams section of the site. However, this will be enabled in future rollouts so it's good to have content in there.

## Adding Coaches

Up to five coaches can be added. If they're an existing staff member (PE teacher, classroom teacher, etc.) listed on the staff section of the website, click on "add existing coach".

Then, search for their name and hit "add coach". This will display their contact information on the athletic teams page.

If the coach is not a staff member listed on the staff section of your site (e.g., part-time football practice coaches), then use the "add new coach" button.

## Adding their website

If the team has a website, add "Website" to the title field, then copy the URL to their website and paste it into the URL field.
