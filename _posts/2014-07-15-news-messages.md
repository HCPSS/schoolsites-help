News messages will appear under the recent news sidebar on your homepage, and also under the news menu tab.

Go to your dashboard and select "add message" in the News (messages) box.

Give your message a descriptive title. Within the message you can add links and bold or italicize text. [Refer to the documentation](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/editing-page/#wysiwyg) if you're unfamiliar with how to edit text.

Underneath the description area of the message there are two more fields: tags and links.

Tags cluster related messages into one place. When you add a tag it displays at the bottom of a message as a clickable link. 

Tags are meant to help users discover more about a particular topic. 

If a message was tagged as "8th Grade Field Trip" and you gave a different message the same tag, both would pop up on the same page after a user clicks on the tag at the bottom of either message. 

Resource inks can be added to the message by creating a new node, or [adding an existing one.](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/moving-nodes/)

For instance, if you already added a school supply list under school resources, just add it as an existing node here for users to easily have access to it.

If you're not familiar with this process, view our [documentation for adding pdf files](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/uploading-files/) and [adding links to other sites](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/adding-links/). 

## Creating an important news message

Important news messages will appear on your site's home page. The home page is allowed five messages at once, you can cycle them out depending on what message is the most important. 

Go to your dashboard and select "Home Page News List"

If you already have a message posted on your site, but now want to bring it to your homepage's forefront, select "add existing node".

![existing message](/schoolsites-help/images/news/existing-message.png) 

If you want to post an entirely new message, select "add new node" and then type up your message.

After you've added your message, you can arrange them based on importance.
