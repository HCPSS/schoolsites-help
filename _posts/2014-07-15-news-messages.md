## Creating a news message

Go to "add content" and select "message."

![news message](/schoolsites-help/images/news/news-message.png)

Give your message a descriptive title. Within the message you can add links and bold or italicize text. [Refer to the documentation](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/editing-page/#wysiwyg) if you're unfamiliar with this process.

![create message](/schoolsites-help/images/news/create-message.png)

Underneath the description area of the message there are two more fields: tags and links.

![create message](/schoolsites-help/images/news/adding-nodes.png)

Links can be added by creating a new node, or adding an existing one.

If you're not familiar with this process, view our [documentation for adding pdf files.](/schoolsites-help/2014/07/15/uploading-files/)

For instance, if you added a school supply list under school resources, just add it as an existing node here for users to easily have access to it. 

Remember that news messages will appear under the recent news sidebar on your homepage, and also under the news menu tab.

## Creating an important news message

- Go to your dashboard and select "Home Page News List"
- If you already have a message posted on your site, but now want to bring it to your homepage's forefront, select "add existing node". 
  - To post an entirely new message, select "add new node" and then type up your message.
- After you've added your message, you can arrange them based on importance for your homepage. 

## Tagging Messages

This is a useful feature to cluster topical messages into one place. When you add a tag it displays at the bottom of a message as a clickable link. 

For instance, if I tagged a message "8th Grade Field Trip" and gave another message the same tag, both would pop up on the same page after someone clicks on the tag at the bottom of either message. Tags are meant to help users discover more about a particular topic.
