Adding images on galleries can be done two ways. The first is to upload images right from your computer ([read how](/schoolsites-help/images/2014/07/15/adding-images/)) and the second is using oembeds from the web.

This is a great way to easily add photos if you have a Flickr or SmugMug account.

## Flickr

Make sure your Flickr photos are public, and if there's any students depicted that they are not on the do not photo list.

Open the image so you're looking at the full image. Copy the link at the top of the page, which should end with some numbers.

From here, go to the attach media section of your gallery and then click "browse". You can also add an oembed image as a Key Image in the high school galleries.

After clicking on attach media navigate to the "web" tab. Paste in the URL from Flickr, and click next.

There will be a defaulted name after clicking next, but feel free to add your own if you'd like. There is also an "alt text" area, [read more about how to use this](/schoolsites-help/images/2014/07/15/adding-images/#alt) if you're unfamiliar.

Click save and the image will be added. It also gets added to your site's library if you want to use it again elsewhere.

## SmugMug

Make sure your SmugMug photos are public, and if there are students depicted that they have media releases on file.

Open the image so you're looking at the full image. Copy the link at the top of the page, which should end with a mixed string of some numbers and letters.

After clicking on attach media navigate to the "web" tab. Paste in the URL from SmugMug, and click next.
