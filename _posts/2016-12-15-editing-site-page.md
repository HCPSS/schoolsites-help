Pages are typically under the various tabs in your navigation. 

> Site managers cannot add pages on their own. Please contact <a href="mailto:vincent_dubay@hcpss.org">vincent_dubay@hpcss.org</a> if you'd like a page added.

For instance, if you wanted to get to the editing screen for your school improvement plan, navigate to the school improvement plan page. 

![access menu](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/edit-sip-menu.png)

Then, click on "edit" to get to the content of the page, which will allow you to edit the contents of the page.

![edit button on page](/schoolsites-help/images/pages/edit-sip.png)

Editing pages is the same as editing content on any other part of the site.

Once you've finished editing the content, don't forget to save.
