Gallery highlights live at the bottom of your homepage. They can arrange galleries you have already made to showcase the most recent or prolific galleries you have on file.

There are two ways to get to the editing view for the gallery highlights. You can hover over the section on the homepage until a cog appears, click the cog and then click on edit.
