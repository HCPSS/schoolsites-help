Your site should already have a School Staff page built with all staff members listed.

## Edit the lists

There are a **few ways** to get to the editing view.

From the dashboard, on the right side there's the "arrange and manage lists" block. Click on "school staff listing".

Another way is to navigate to the staff page and click on the "edit" tab.

Alternatively, you can hover over a particular department until a cog appears. Click on the cog and then edit. Using this method, you'll only be able to edit content that exists within that department.

Any of these ways work to edit the content.

## Editing a department

To go in and edit any department click on "edit" next to the department name. 

![edit any department](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/edit-any-department.png)

> If needed, you can also click on "remove" and then check off the box to delete the department. However, it will not delete the staff members who are listed.

> ![remove any department](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/remove-deptartment.png)

After clicking on edit you will see a list of the associated staff members. You can also re-name the department or add the department's website.

## Removing, adding and editing staff members

If you're replacing a staff member who has left your school, click on remove next to their name and make sure the checkbox is checked off.

To add a new staff member, go to "add new staff member".

![add new staff member](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/add-new-staff.png)

There are fields to fill out for your new staff member. Only the staff name, first, and last name are required. However, the job title and email address helps out parents who are searching for staff members and want to contact them.

After editing their information, click on "create staff member".

If you created a new staff member or even you just removed a few staff members, click on "update department" to finish.

Then, click on "save" at the bottom of the screen to save your work.

## Move a department staff member

If you have a staff member moving from one department to another click on "remove" next to edit, but **do not** check off the checkbox.

![remove next to edit, right of their name](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/remove-edit-member.png)

![remove temporary](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/remove-temp.png)

After clicking on "remove", click on "update department".

Next, open up the department you want to move the staff member to by clicking on "edit" to the right of the department's name, and then "add existing staff member".

![add new staff member](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/add-new-staff.png)

This opens up a search box with all staff members entered into your system. Search for the staff member that you recently removed.

The number to the right of their name indicates how recently they were added. The higher the number, the more recent it was.

![search for a staff member](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/search.png)

Click on "add staff member" once you've found them.

At any point you can move around staff members depending on the order you'd like using the directional compasses to the left of their names.

Click on "update department" once you've made your changes. To save your work, click on "save" at the bottom of the screen.

## Adding a new deparment

If you have a new department to add, navigate to the school staff page that has all of your school's departments listed. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on add new department.

![add new department](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/add-new-department.png)

You can title the department here and add a website if they have one. Then, add new staff members or existing staff members to the department.

![add new department finish](/schoolsites-help/images/hs-staff/new-department-staff.png)

After it's all set, click on "create department" and then save.

You can move your departments around using the directional compasses to the left of the department titles. Be sure to save once you've re-arranged them.
