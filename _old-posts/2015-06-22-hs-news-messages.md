## How it works

News items are an important aspect of your site. They can be added to your homepage to highlight important events, or kept on the news page for a quick reference point. Every news item that is posted on your site pushes automatically to the HCPSS mobile application. Parents subscribed to your school via the app can now receive news in a much more timely manner, and every news item is posted on your site is given a unique URL that can be shared on social media or in a weekly SchoolMessenger newsletter.

There is detailed documentation for developing a <a href="http://hcpss.github.io/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/editorial-process.html" target="_blank">news editorial process</a> similar to what Public Information uses. Feel free to review it for more ideas on how to keep news on your site, newsletter, and mobile application in sync.

## Title and Content

After logging in, go to your dashboard and on the left-hand side there's an admin area for news messages. Click on "add message" to start composing a news message.

Give it a descriptive title. Ideally, titles shouldn't be more than ten words in length.

The content area is where the meat of your story goes. This can be as long as you'd like, but remember that readers appreciate articles that are concise and kept at a maximum of 200 words.

The toolbar allows you to add styles to your content, <a href="">read more about how to use it</a>.

## Summary

This will be shown when your message appears on the news page of your site. It also displays when posted on your homepage. This feature allows users to quickly preview your content before reading more.

Try to keep the summaries under one sentence, or 100 words.

## Tagging messages

There's an associated program field to fill out that site managers don't have to worry about quite yet. Web Services has plans for it in the future, but at the moment it can be left blank.

However, your messages can certainly be tagged.

These tags are already configured for your school's website and allow you to categorize messages based on their content.

Select a tag that best fits with your message. However, if there isn't anything that fits, don't worry about tagging the message because it isn't mandatory.

If users click on the tag within a message, they will be brought to a page that places all messages tagged with the same thing in one place.

## Saving

Once your news item is all set, simply hit save and you'll be brought to the news item. Alternatively, hitting save and add another saves the item you finished working on and allows you to start writing another post.

## Going back and editing again

Say you want to fix a typo or update a news item after publishing, there's a quick way to get back in and edit.

Navigate to the item you posted and you'll notice three tabs at the top of the item. Click on "edit" to get back into the news item.

The edits will not change the published date.
